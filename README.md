# Pipeline-as-code-demo-gradle

<br/>
The repository is intended for the build pipeline automation by simply writing a Groovy script(or a Pipeline DSL)<br/>
The Jenkinsfile contains the script by which we can easily configure our build pipeline without thinking much about configurations<br/>
<strong>Plus</strong><br/>
We can clone multiple repositories at the same time and run tasks in a cascade manner thereby facilitating <Strong>Multi-Project build</strong><br/>
